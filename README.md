# Web-Design-Challenge
Temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speeds may vary depending on one's location on the planet. In this exercise, a website was created to display the effect of one's location relative to the equator on the four items mentioned. The pages of the site will show the different plots comparing Latitude vs. Max Temp, Latitude vs. Humidity,
Latitude vs. Cloudiness and Latitude vs. Wind Speed. The raw data used for the plotting was pulled using the OpenWeather API and is included under the Data page.
